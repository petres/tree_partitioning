tree_partitioning.py

Implement rooted trees with weights on leaves. Weight of non-leaf vertices
are defined by the weight of their children.

Our goal is to create an arbitrary rooted tree with positive weighted leaves
and to partition the tree into equally weighted subtrees, that is a set of
subtrees such that the leaves of each subtree have approximately equal weight
and form a partition of all leaves of the original tree. Since there might not
be an exact solution, the algorithm tries to minimize the squared error for a
given target weight for each of the subtrees.
